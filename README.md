# Researching Group

The Research group is reposnibile for analyzing and exploring new topics for each of the project's obectives throughout the weeks. The information found can help the teammembers progress witht the tasks.  

Each of the documentations you create should provide some sort of analysis of what you are documenting, pros, cons and why.
If your documentation contains code, make sure to share that code with the team so they can use it.



# Documentations

Throughout the semester, you are responsible to complete a minimum of 6 hours a week of “out of class” work.

These hours should represent the amount of work you put into each documentation you’ve made. 

Each documentation is a task that needs to be complete to finish the class project.

Check out the wiki pages to analyze previously completed documentations. You can use the work to build on as 
well as to help you work on your documentation.
