# Researching Group

The Research group is reposnibile for analyzing and exploring new topics for each of the project's obectives throughout the weeks. The information found can help the teammembers progress witht the tasks.  

Each of the documentations you create should provide some sort of analysis of what you are documenting, pros, cons and why.
If your documentation contains code, make sure to share that code with the team so they can use it.
