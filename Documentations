Throughout the semester, you are responsible to complete a minimum of 6 hours a week of “out of class” work.
These hours should represent the amount of work you put into each documentation you’ve made. 
Each documentation is a task that needs to be complete to finish the class project.
Check out the wiki pages to analyze previously completed documentations. You can use the work to build on as 
well as to help you work on your documentation.
